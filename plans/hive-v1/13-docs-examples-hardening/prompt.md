# Codex prompt — Plan 13 (Docs/examples/hardening)

You are implementing **Plan 13** from `plans/hive-v1/13-docs-examples-hardening/plan.md`.

## Objective

Add docs and runnable examples, and ensure all “definition of done” items in `HIVE_SPEC.md` §18 are met and documented.

## Constraints

- Keep docs concise and example-driven.
- Don’t change runtime semantics; this phase is about packaging, documentation, and validation.
- Ensure `cd libs/hive && swift test` is green for all targets.
