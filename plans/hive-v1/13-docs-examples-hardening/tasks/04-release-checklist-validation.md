Prompt:
Create a short release checklist and validate required test passes for Hive targets and SwiftAgents integration.

Goal:
Close the Definition of Done requirement for validation and release readiness.

Task Breakdown:
- Draft a concise “release checklist” covering manual validation steps (e.g., Xcode build).
- Run `swift test` for all Hive targets.

- Record any failures and required follow-ups.

Expected Output:
- A short release checklist document.
- A validation summary stating which test suites passed or failed and what remains.
