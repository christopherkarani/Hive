Prompt:
Add one or two small runnable examples that exercise the core semantics: tiny graph, Send/fan-out, and interrupt/resume. Examples should be iOS/macOS oriented and easy to run.

Goal:
Demonstrate core Hive semantics in a minimal, executable form to satisfy the examples requirement.

Task Breakdown:
- Decide on example location: `examples/` or `libs/hive/Examples/`.
- Design a minimal graph example that runs in-process.
- Include Send/fan-out usage in the example.
- Include interrupt/resume in the example.
- Validate example build/run steps and document them in a short README.

Expected Output:
- One or two runnable example projects or scripts.
- Example README with clear run instructions and expected output behavior.
